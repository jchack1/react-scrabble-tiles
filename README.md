This was assignment 2 for my React udemy course, where we were practicing lists and conditionals. It required an input field, and the user's text was to be output to the screen in a tile format. A text length was to be chosen, and conditional statements were used inside a validation component to determine if the text was too short or long enough - a message would show on the screen letting the user know. Additionally, if a user were to click on a tile, the tile would be deleted, and the updated text would be reflected in the input box. I decided to style the tiles like scrabble tiles. I deployed the app using Heroku and a Node.js server, like my previous React apps.
